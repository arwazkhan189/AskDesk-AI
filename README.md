# AskDesk AI - Your Smart On-Screen Question Answering Assistant
AskDesk AI is a lightweight desktop assistant that captures on-screen questions and provides instant AI-generated answers. Designed for developers, students, and educators, it supports two modes:

- Programming Mode (Ctrl + Q) – Detects code-related questions and returns clean, comment-free code in the selected language (Python, C++, Java).

- MCQ Mode (Ctrl + M) – Detects multiple-choice questions and returns the correct option with a brief explanation.

The app uses OCR to read screen text, Gemini AI to answer, and a built-in Flask server to display live Q&A in a browser. It also auto-copies the answer to your clipboard for quick use.
